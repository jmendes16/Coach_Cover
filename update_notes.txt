for event in calendar.walk('VEVENT'):
    print(event.get('DTSTART').dt,event.get('TRANSP'),event.get('RRULE'),event.get('ATTENDEE'))

# events don't exist until people book into them
# don't need transparent events but these are days/quarters registered earlier on in the life of the calendar
# don't need RRULE (recurrence rule) events

# solution for missing events (ones where no one has booked in), make them in Python script
